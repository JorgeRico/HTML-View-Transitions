                    <h2 class="color-title ml10">Fighting Style</h2>
                </div>
                <div class="left w100">
                    <p class="ml30">Piccolo has one the greatest fight IQs and keenest senses of any of the fighters. He is cool calm collected under pressure, and often makes the right tactical moves in battle to give himself the best chance of winning. Although he doesn’t always win, he always gives a good account of himself. While his Namekian body gives him several advantages in battle, it has also held him back, as he’s never going to reach the highs of a Saiyan.</p>
                    <p class="ml30">Piccolo is a highly disciplined individual, and seems to be in a constant state of training, through meditation. While this technique did help him get fairly strong, it could also be holding him back. He’s got a lot of pride like Vegeta, and so doesn’t like being trained by others. Even when trained by the great King Kai he spent the whole time moaning, and didn’t really take his training to heart.</p>
                    <p class="ml30">As a fighter Piccolo likes to start off slow, observing his enemy before making his game plan. If he can sit back and have a team mate start a fight, then all the better for him. After relaxing for the first few rounds, Piccolo normally formulates a plan to win, and often finds ways of outsmarting his opponent. Even if he isn’t strong enough to beat an enemy himself, he can normally provide a game plan to an ally with more power.</p>
                    <p class="ml30">Another thing that makes Piccolo so formidable, and gives him advantages over humans and Saiyans, are his Namekian abilities. He has far superior eyesight and hearing, and can also regenerate lost limbs fairly quickly. Not to mention he can stretch his arms like Stretch Arm Strong. All of these neat tricks help him stay relevant, even though his power level may not be on par with his pals. Piccolo is definitely you want someone on your team.</p>

                        <p>One of the most powerful attacks in Dragon Ball. This attack takes a long time to charge but produces a yellow beam with spiralling Ki surrounding it, that is several times stronger than it's user.</p>
                        <p>It is charged by placing two fingers on your forehead and then released by pointing the two fingers at the target.</p>

                        <h3 class="color-title">Eye Lasers</h3>
                        <p>An extremely quick and effective technique that can catch opponents off guard.</p>
                        <p>The user can instantly fire 2 laser beams out of their eyes which acts as an electric shock to stun whoever they touch.</p>

                        <h3 class="color-title">Masenko</h3>
                        <p>This two handed attack can be charged and fired relatively quickly, and produces a large and powerful yellow Ki beam. The user puts his hands in front of him, points them at their target and shouts Masenko to fire it.</p>
                        <p>Piccolo taught this technique to his favourite student Gohan in Dragon Ball Z.</p>

                        <p>Due to Piccolo's Namek DNA he is able to regenerate any limbs that get destroyed or cut off.</p>
                        <p>Although there is no limit to the amount of times he can do this it does take a lot of energy, meaning Piccolo needs to charge this ability.</p>
