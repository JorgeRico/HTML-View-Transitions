                    <h2 class="color-title ml10">Fighting Style</h2>
                </div>
                <div class="left w100">
                    <p class="ml30">Even though Vegeta changed sides to the good guys, he still always fought like a bad guy. Every punch he throws he tried to knock out his opponent, and every blast he shoots, he shoots to kill. Vegeta’s fighting style is relentless. He’s not interesting in pulling punches like Goku to warm up, Vegeta aims to ends fights as quickly as possible.</p>
                    <p class="ml30">His biggest weakness, is also his biggest asset, and that’s his Saiyan’s pride. Vegeta’s pride makes his fearless and arrogant enough to think he can win any fight, but also makes him take on fights he can’t win and prevents him working as part of a team.</p>
                    <p class="ml30">In the gym Vegeta is quite possibly the hardest worker, and he practically lives into the gravity chamber when not fighting/training with Whis. He famously spent 2 days (same as 2 years) in the time chamber to train for Cell, which is an absolutely brutal ordeal to put his body through. However Vegeta falls victim to the classic pitfall of working harder, not smarter. Goku seemingly gets better results with less training than Vegeta, but Vegeta now working with Whis could mean that he’s learning his lesson.</p>
                    <p class="ml30">Vegeta is almost the perfect individual warrior. He’s extremely smart and tactical, and doesn’t just rely on his brute strength, even though he’s one of the naturally strongest fighters. He’s been fighting his entire life, and has such a vast wealth of battle experience to draw from, he rarely gets outsmarted or tricked. But Vegeta’s pride and lack of willingness to work as a team is generally his undoing.</p>
                    <p class="ml30">When melee attacks fail, than Vegeta has a large arsenal of Ki attacks he’s honed over the years, designed to cause as much pain as possible. You won’t catch Vegeta doing an expelliarmus or a kamehameha. As mentioned earlier his attacks are set to kill, not stun.</p>
                    <p class="ml30">Even though Vegeta’s teamwork leaves a lot to be desired, one thing you can’t question is his ability to put his body on the line. When Vegeta know’s he’s done for, he has not trouble sacrificing himself to protect his love ones, one of the few ways he shows that he cares.</p>

                        <h3 class="color-title">Galick Gun</h3>
                        <p>Vegeta's ultimate move, the Galick Gun launches a powerful purple beam that seems to emanate from Vegeta's whole body. </p>
                        <p>Although it's not as powerful as the Kamehameha it's much quicker to fire, making it preferable to use in a fast paced battle situation.</p>

                        <h3 class="color-title">Lucora Gun</h3>
                        <p>Lucora gun is a rapid fire attack which sees Vegeta launch hundreds of mini ki blasts at his target, taking a scorched earth approach to defeating his target.</p>
                        <p>Vegeta has used it constantly throughout Dragon Ball Z and Dragon Ball Super, maybe more than the Galick Gun.</p>

                        <h3 class="color-title">Final Flash</h3>
                        <p>Although this technique takes a while to charge, it packs one hell of a punch, even managing to blast Perfect Cell's top half to smithereens.</p>
                        <p>Vegeta needs to charge it with his arms apart before bring them together in front of him forming a ball in his hand before it's let loose.</p>

                        <h3 class="color-title">Final Explosion</h3>
                        <p>This is Vegeta's nuclear option. When he knows he can't win the battle but wants to save him friends Vegeta can concentrate all his power to his body and cause an explosions that likely kills him and anyone in the area.</p>
                        <p>He's used this against Majin Buu and Top.</p>
