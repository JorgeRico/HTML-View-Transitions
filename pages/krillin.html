                    <h2 class="color-title ml10">Fighting Style</h2>
                </div>
                <div class="left w100">
                    <p class="ml30">Krillin is an extremely clever and tactical fighter. Even though he doesnâ€™t have the natural strength of Vegeta or Goku, he often uses quick thinking and teamwork to overcome stronger enemies.</p>
                    <p class="ml30">He is trained in the art of Termit Hermit fighting, and is an adept at both Melee and Ki attacks. Not counting the Androids, Krillin is probably the strongest human, which is quite an accomplishment.</p>
                    <p class="ml30">Like Goku, when Krillin was young he had a scrappy Melee style and relied on his superior strength to beat opponents. But when dealing with the aliens of Dragon Ball Z, Krillin incorporated more Ki into his fighting style, and took on the defensive/supportive role.</p>
                    <p class="ml30">His most famous Ki attack is the Destructo Disk which he really made his own, almost killing Nappa and Frieza with.</p>
                    <p class="ml30">Krillin prefers to fight alongside his friends, and often plays the role of the distraction/interfeerer to allow his more powerful allies to get in attacks. Krillin normally has a bag full of Sensu beans, meaning he can play medic to help his friends when they are in need of restoration.</p>

                        <h3 class="color-title">Destructo Disc</h3>
                        <p>The mighty destructo disk is so sharp it can cut any physical object. The technique allows the user to produce a far more powerful attack than there power level would suggest, and Krillin was able to use it to cut off Frieza's tail.</p>
                        <p>Krillin also uses it cleverly to destroy objects like mountains to crush enemies.</p>

                        <h3 class="color-title">Kamehameha</h3>
                        <p>Although Goku is most famous for using this move, it is infact Master Roshi's technique and is taught to all Turtle Hermit students.</p>
                        <p>Krillin first used it in the World Martial Arts tournament as a young lad.</p>

                        <h3 class="color-title">Solar Flare</h3>
                        <p>Borrowed from Tien, the Solar Flare is a great defensive move that blinds opponents temporarily, allowing for a quick getaway.</p>
                        <p>Krillin pioneers the Solar Flare X 100 during Dragon Ball Super.</p>
